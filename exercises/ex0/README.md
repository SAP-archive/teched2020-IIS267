Explanation	Screenshot
1.	Open tile Forensic Lab in the SAP Enterprise Threat Detection Launchpad. 
2.	The initial screen of the forensic lab shows the log events from last 15 minutes. The left part of the workspace contains the filter paths. The right part of the workspace is used to display the log events. They are called browsing charts. You can e.g. see which log types â€“ Event, Log Type - are received, from which systems - System ID, Actor - or which actions - Event (Semantic) - have been performed. Change the drop-down value in one of the browsing charts to see information about other semantic attributes.	 
	
3.	Push button Change time period.
Change time period selection to 1 hour and push button OK to analyze the log events from last day. 

Look at the path and the browsing charts that have been updated. 
	 
4.	To add a filter for failed logon events, click on legend User Logon, Failure.	 
5.	Select menu item Add to Path. This will create a filter for failed logons that have been occurred in the last day. It is shown as Subset in the filter path.	 
6.	Look at Path1 and see the subset that has been added. Observe that the browsing charts have been updated as well.
